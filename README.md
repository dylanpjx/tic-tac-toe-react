# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
Tic-tac-toe website made using React following the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

Key learning points: 
- Break a website up into multipe working components 
- Components should have a "trickle up" effect, where `props` and `functions` should be in the parent component and the child component is just used for rendering
- Never modify the original `props`/`state`, always modify a copy of the original, immutability is impt
